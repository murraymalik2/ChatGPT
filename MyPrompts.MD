"Explain to me, as if I was a student, what a boolean expression is."

Sure! As a student, let me explain what a Boolean expression is. In computer science and mathematics, a Boolean expression is a statement or equation that evaluates to either true or false. It is named after mathematician and logician George Boole.

Boolean expressions use logical operators like “and,” “or,” and “not” to combine conditions or values and determine their truth value. These operators help us compare and manipulate true and false values. Here are some examples to illustrate:

	1.	The expression “5 > 3” compares whether 5 is greater than 3. If true, the expression evaluates to true; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
	2.	The expression “x > 10 and y < 20” combines two conditions using the “and” operator. Both conditions need to be true for the entire expression to be true. Otherwise, it will be false.
	3.	The expression “not (x == y)” uses the “not” operator to negate the result of the condition “x == y.” If the condition is true, the “not” operator makes it false, and vice versa.

Boolean expressions are fundamental in programming as they help control the flow of programs, make decisions, and perform logical operations. By using Boolean expressions, we can write code that responds differently based on certain conditions, making our programs more powerful and flexible.
